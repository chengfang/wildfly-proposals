== Overview

Currently the only way to enable properties resolution in the CLI is to update the XML configuration file.
Having to update the XML file creates complexity when automating CLI execution.
CLI has some command line options that override the content of the XML configuration.
We are here proposing to introduce a new command line option to enable properties resolution.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Ability to enable property resolution via CLI option. We are re-using the XML element name
as the option name. This option has no value, 
----
./jboss-cli.sh --resolve-parameter-values
----

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* NONE

=== Non-Requirements

* Ability to disable property resolution via CLI option. 

== Test Plan

* New test in standalone to start CLI with --resolve-parameter-values and check
that the system property is resolved prior to be sent to server.

== Community Documentation
The CLI comes with its own documentation (help). Having a new entry for the option
should be enough.
